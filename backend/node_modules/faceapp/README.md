##### JavaScript API wrapper for the FaceApp tool for Android and iOS. Licensed under ISC License.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
`faceapp.js` is an **unofficial** reverse-engineering of the mobile clients and the servers they interact with. This means that it is subject to any of their limitations.  
This includes their rate limits. **I will not attempt to bypass this as that would break their terms of service**, please stop asking ‚ù§.

***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

### Rate Limits
**NOTE:** These are just an estimation based on my own testing.  
The FaceApp servers only accept 100 requests in a 10 minute window. Because `process()` uses two API calls, you can only use `process()` 50 times during that 10 minute window.

## üíæ Installation
The package is on the NPM registry as `faceapp`. Simply install it with your NPM client of choice.

## üîß Usage
First, import the module:
```js
const faceapp = require('faceapp')
```

The `process()` function takes two parameters:
* `path: string | file: Buffer` - Path to the image file you would like to process. Or a Buffer object representing an image.
* `filterID: string` - FaceApp Filter ID

### üìù Example
```js
// Import the module
const faceapp = require('faceapp')

// Process the image (filepath)
let image = await faceapp.process('path/to/image.png', 'smile_2')

// Process the image (buffer)
// First we have to get a buffer
let { body } = await superagent.get('http://example.com/image.png')
let image = await faceapp.process(body, 'hot')
```

### ‚å® CLI
There is a CLI available. Install the package globally using `npm i -g faceapp` and then run `faceapp` to access the CLI.

### üìú Filter IDs
Known Filters: |  |  |  |  |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
`no-filter` | `smile` | `smile_2` | `hot` | `old` |
`young` | `female_2` | `female` | `male` | `pan` |
`hitman` | `hollywood` | `heisenberg` | `impression` | `lion` |
`goatee` | `hipster` | `bangs` | `glasses` | `wave` |
`makeup` |

However, you can get an up-to-date list of all available filter IDs from the API directly using the `listFilters` function.

```js
let filters = await faceapp.listFilters()
// Returns an array of Filter objects

let filters = await faceapp.listFilters(true)
// Returns an array filter ID strings
```
